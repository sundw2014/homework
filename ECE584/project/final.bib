	relational abstractions for the continuous dynamics with (b) automated

	automaton. The algorithm is complete for automata that are symmetric
	with respect to the chosen Lyapunov functions. The algorithm is implemented
	in a prototype tool (LySHA ) which is integrated with a Simulink/Stateflow
	frontend for modeling hybrid systems. The experimental results demonstrate
	the effectiveness of the methodology in verifying inevitability of
	hybrid automata with up to five continuous dimensions and forty locations.},

	Safe flocking in Euclidean spaces is a well-studied and difficult
	coordination problem. In this paper, we study one-dimensional safe
	flocking in the presence of actuator faults and directional failure
	detectors (DFDs). Actuator faults cause affected agents to move permanently
	with arbitrary velocities, and DFDs detect failures only when actuation
	and required motion are in opposing directions. First, assuming existence
	of a DFD for actuator faults, we present an algorithm for safe flocking.
	Next, we show that certain actuator faults cannot be detected with
	DFDs, while detecting others requires time that grows linearly with
	the number of participating agents. Finally, we show that our DFD
	algorithm achieves the latter bound.},

	Nodes (VNs), and local broadcast communication. The VNs are associated
	with predetermined regions in the plane and coordinate among themselves
	to distribute the client nodes relatively uniformly among the VNs�
	regions. Each VN directs its local client nodes to align themselves
	on the local portion of the target curve. The resulting motion coordination
	protocol is self-stabilizing, in that each robot can begin the execution
	in any arbitrary state and at any arbitrary location in the plane.
	In addition, self-stabilization ensures that the robots can adapt

  abstract = {In this paper, we provide a dynamic graph theoretic framework for flocking in presence of multiple obstacles. In particular, we give formal definitions of nets and flocks as spatially induced graphs and define flocking. We introduce the notion of framenets and describe a procedure for automatic construction of an energy function for groups of agents. The task of flocking is achieved via dissipation of this energy according to a protocol that only requires the use of local information. We show that all three rules of Reynolds are hidden in this single protocol. Three types of agents called $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ agents are used to create flocking. Simulation results are provided that demonstrate flocking by 100 dynamic agents.},

	abstract = {Distributed systems are notorious for harboring subtle bugs. Verification can, in principle, eliminate these bugs a priori, but verification has historically been difficult to apply at full-program scale, much less distributed-system scale. We describe a methodology for building practical and provably correct distributed systems based on a unique blend of TLA-style state-machine refinement and Hoare-logic verification. We demonstrate the methodology on a complex implementation of a Paxos-based replicated state machine library and a lease-based sharded key-value store. We prove that each obeys a concise safety specification, as well as desirable liveness requirements. Each implementation achieves performance competitive with a reference system. With our methodology and lessons learned, we aim to raise the standard for distributed systems from "tested" to "correct."},

We describe a system --- Ivy --- for interactively verifying safety of infinite-state systems. Ivy's key principle is that whenever verification fails, Ivy graphically displays a concrete counterexample to induction. The user then interactively guides generalization from this counterexample. This process continues until an inductive invariant is found. Ivy searches for universally quantified invariants, and uses a restricted modeling language. This ensures that all verification conditions can be checked algorithmically. All user interactions are performed using graphical models, easing the user's task. We describe our initial experience with verifying several distributed protocols.},

We show how DVF can be used to prove correct a classical, fault-tolerant, distributed protocol for consensus, and describe how a protocol expert starting from scratch, with little-to-no prior familiarity with SMT or DVF, was able to model the protocol and prove it correct in six days and nine pages.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, the full verification of a programâs functional correctness has been obtained with pen and paper or with interactive proof assistants, whereas only reduced verification tasks, such as extended static checking, have enjoyed the automation offered by satisfiability-modulo-theories (SMT) solvers. More recently, powerful SMT solvers and well-designed program verifiers are starting to break that tradition, thus reducing the effort involved in doing full verification.This paper gives a tour of the language and verifier Dafny, which has been used to verify the functional correctness of a number of challenging pointer-based programs. The paper describes the features incorporated in Dafny, illustrating their use by small examples and giving a taste of how they are coded for an SMT solver. As a larger case study, the paper shows the full functional specification of the Schorr-Waite algorithm in Dafny.},
